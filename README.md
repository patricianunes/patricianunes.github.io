Welcome to my Personal Website

This is a site to show my work, help me to find a job and after I get my first challenging as a Junior Software Developer I will start to post my articles and transfor my Personal Website in a blog post.

The objective of the project was to use all the technologies and knowledge that I have learned to show a litle bit about me and my work.

I wrote the project with **React, HTML, CSS**. 

First my beloved husband help me with the design (he is a senior web developer), then I start with each component showing the content and using CSS to make everything mach with the design.

After doing the basics I try to improve my code and make looks better, but I have a lot to make to improve my code and finish what I really want like some animations with JS!

I really wanted to make my project the most simply possible, easy to read and understandable.

Still need some good thinks like, integration with GitHub, tags with the tecnologies, animation on my skills image, but everything could be better and better.
