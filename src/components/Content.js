      <p>Junior Web Developer, based in Sydney, seeking for my first job.</p>
      <p>
        I just finished the ​Software Engineering Immersive course at GA. Now I
        am looking for a junior position preferable as a ​Frontend​, but I am
        also keen to work as a ​Backend.​
      </p>
      <p>
        The kind of company that I want to work with cares about its employees
        as much as it does about the technology.
